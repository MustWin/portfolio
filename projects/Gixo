Gixo Alpha

Techonologies we Loved: Java, Objective-C, WebRTC, HTTP Live Streaming.

LovableTech helped create the scaffolds necessary to launch the Gixo Alpha and perform product testing.
We implemented a HTTP Live Streaming pipeline to deliver rich media without sacrificing Battery consumption or Data usage.

We also implemented a WebRTC client to stream realtime video on iOS Devices.
This allowed Gixo to perform early user testing and prove their concept to both investors and partners.
