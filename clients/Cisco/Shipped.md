## Summary

We built Cisco a PaaS offering that handles the entire SDLC (software development lifecycle) handling all your needs from development to operations.

It's aimed at easily building containerized microservice oriented applications. Developers start with deployable buildpacks to get an application deployed
in just a few minutes. We setup a continuous integration environment for your repository automatically, and we can even create a local development environment
based on your microservices automatically. Whenever anyone commits, their code is built and they can deploy their application to any cloud with the push 
of a button.
