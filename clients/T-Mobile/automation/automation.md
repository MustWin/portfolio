# T-Mobile

## Summary

T-mobile launched an initiative to have every single one of their hundreds of services automatically built, tested, and deployed to test environments for integration testing. Must Win helped build the automation scripts to launch clusters in VRA, install required components with Ansible, and then to deploy application code from Artifactory.

Alongside this automation initiative, we also helped design the next generation application engine at T-mobile. Applications will be containerized using docker, built and tested automatically in the Jenkins pipeline, then deployed onto a shared Mesos cluster for integration testing before being promoted to production.
