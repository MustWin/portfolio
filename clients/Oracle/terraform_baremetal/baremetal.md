# Oracle Baremetal

## Summary

Oracle launched their new Baremetal Cloud Services, and contracted with MustWin to build a Golang SDK and a Hashicorp Terraform provider to both provide their user base with a simple, programmable interface and to encourage their users to develop their infrastructure management software using modern best practices such as “infrastructure as code”. We developed automation solutions for creating networks, subnets, compute instances, database instances, users, groups, policies, buckets, objects, databases, load balancers, and more.
